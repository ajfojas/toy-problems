/*
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

var climbStairs = function(n) {
  // Keep track of total number of distinct ways to climb to the top
  // Have a recursive function that intakes the number of steps remaining
    // Iterate through number of climbing options
    // Base case: return when number of steps remaining === 0
    // Recursive case: if steps remaining - climbing option >= 0, keep recursing
  // Return total distinct ways to climb
};

// O() space
// O() time
