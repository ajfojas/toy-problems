/*
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

var missingNumber = function(nums) {
  // I can optimize either for:
  // 1. O(n * log(n)) time and O(1) space by sorting the array first
  // 2. O(n)          time and O(n) space by using a set and deleting entries with values I encounter
  // I think optimizing for time would be better from a UX point of view
};

// O() space - 
// O() time -
