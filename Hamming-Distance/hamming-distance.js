/*
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

var hammingDistance = function(x, y) {
  // Convert both inputs to binary as strings
  // Keep track of # differences
  // Iterate through the longer string backwards
    // If either index is null, break
    // If difference between inputs at current index, increment counter
  // Add amount of leftover digits of longer string to counter
  // Return counter
};

// O() space - 
// O() time -
