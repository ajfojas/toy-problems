/*
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

  // Have a obj that stores char/index as key and count as value
  // Iterate through s and store char/count in obj
  // Iterate through s again and return index of 1st non-repeating char
  // If it doesn't exist, return -1
};
